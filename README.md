# iOpenSongs

Welcome to the iOpenSong project.

This project aims to implement a native iPad application that can read and manage [OpenSong](http://opensong.org) files.

## What is OpenSong?

> OpenSong is a free, open-source software application created to manage lyrics, chords, lead sheets, overheads, computer projection, and more.   
>   
> OpenSong releases are available for Microsoft Windows, Mac OSX, and Linux operating systems.   
>   
> [Download](http://opensong.org/d/downloads) the full application for free and give it a try!

## Screenshots / More Infos

Visit the [AppStore site](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/iopensongs/id501589566?mt=8) for screenshots and more info on the current release.

## Getting Started

Cocoa dependencies are handled using CocoaPods. You will need Ruby to install it as a Ruby Gem.

To install them run

    gem install cocoapods
    pod install

:warning: Remember to open the resulting iOpenSongs.xcworkspace file instead of iOpenSongs.xcodeproj

Everything else is included, except the icon set.
The icons used can be purchased here: http://glyphicons.com/

You can also change the icons in your own project if you cannot build because of the missing icons.

I will ask the author of the icons if it is ok to distribute them with the source files.
Until then please buy them, they are really good.

## Debugging

The project has added support for Square's [PonyDebugger](https://github.com/square/PonyDebugger).
So install their Python server and connect with Chrome to

    http://localhost:9000
