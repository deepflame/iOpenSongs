  <lyrics>[V1]
.Em                B
 Welcomed into the courts of the King,
.    Gmaj7                 A2
 I am    ushered into your presence.
.Em                    B
 Lord, I stand on Your merciful ground,
.        Gmaj7                     A2
 Yet with    every step tread with reverence.
  
  
[C]
.         G        C
 And I'll fall facedown
.        Em    D       C
 As Your glory shines around.
.          G        C
 Yes, I'll fall facedown
.        Em    D       C
 As Your glory shines around.
  
  
[V2]
.Em                  B
 Who is there in the heavens like You?
.     Gmaj7                      A2
 And upon  the earth, who's Your equal?
.        Em                    B
 You are far above, You're the highest of heights;
.       Gmaj7          A2
 We are bowing down to exalt you.
  
  
[B]
.C                        D
 So let Your glory shine around.
.                      C
 Let Your glory shine around.
.                      D
 King of glory here be found. King of glory.
  
  
[T]
.Em                B
 Welcomed into the courts of the King
.    Gmaj7                 A2
 I am    ushered into your presence</lyrics>
