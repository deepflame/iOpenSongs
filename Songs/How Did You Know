E7           AM7 The day that you came into my life.Am                E You asked for my name.             F#m            B   B7 You had the most beautiful smile.    E                B My life started to change.                 E7            AM7 I'd wake up each day feeling alright.     Am               E With you right by my side.               F#m        B             E Makes me feel things will work out just fine [C].             E How did you know.             C#m7                F#m I needed someone like you in my life.                  B7                E That there was an empty space in my heart.                 C#m7             F#m B7 You came at the right time in my life.              E I'll never forget.                    C#m7               F#m How you brought the sun to shine in my life.                  B7          G#7         C#m Am And took all the worries and fears that I had.                  E               F#m I guess what I'm really trying to say.               E                    Am It's not everyday that someone like you comes my way.    E          C#m       F#m B7 No words can express how much.        E I love you. </lyrics></song>
