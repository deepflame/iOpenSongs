  <lyrics>[V1]
.D       D7          G         D
 Amazing grace how sweet the sound
.     D                   A
 That saved a wretch like me
.  D        D7         G      D
 I once was lost, but now am found
.    D         G   A  D
 Was blind but now I see
 
[V2]
.D       D7        G         D
 T'was grace that taught my heart to fear,
.     D                   A
 And grace my fears relieved;
.  D        D7        G      D
 How precious did that grace appear
.    D         G   A  D
 The hour I first believed. 
 
[V3]
.D       D7        G         D
 Through many dangers, toil and snares,
.     D                   A
 I have already come;
.  D        D7        G      D
 'Tis grace has brought me safe thus far,
.    D         G   A  D
 And grace will lead me home. 
 
[V4]
.D       D7        G         D
 When we've been there ten thousand years
.     D                   A
 Bright shining as the sun,
.  D        D7        G      D
 We've no less days to sing God's praise
.    D         G   A  D
 Than when we've first begun.
